# ðŸ§  LLMOps Example Project

This repository contains a hands-on example of **LLMOps** (Large Language Model Operations), demonstrating how to prepare data, automate prompt pipelines, and ensure prompt safety for predictions.

## ðŸ“‚ Notebooks Included

- `Data_Preparation.ipynb`  
  Prepare and format data for LLM tasks.

- `Antomation.ipynb`  
  Automate prompt generation and task orchestration.  
  

- `Predictions_Prompts_Safetym.ipynb`  
  Ensure safe prompt execution and validate prediction outputs.  

## ðŸš€ Purpose

This project showcases a end-to-end LLMOps pipeline â€” from data preprocessing to automation and safety validation â€” ideal for learning scalable and reliable LLM deployment practices.
